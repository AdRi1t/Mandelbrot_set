# HIP Accelerated Mandelbrot Set

This project is a visualizer for the Mandelbrot set, it lets you explore this famous mathematical fractal.

> **Note:** This project is based on the original work by Sol from [solarianprogrammer.com](http://www.solarianprogrammer.com). The original project can be found at: [http://solarianprogrammer.com/2013/02/28/mandelbroot-set-cpp-11/](http://solarianprogrammer.com/2013/02/28/mandelbroot-set-cpp-11/)

## Prerequisites

- CMake (version 3.23.0 or higher)
- C++ compiler compatible with C++20
- SFML 2 devel (for graphical interface)
- FreeImage (for image saving)
- HIP for GPU acceleration

## Installation

### Installing Dependencies

On linux like systems, you can install the required dependencies using your *package manager*.

```bash
sudo package_manager install build-essential cmake libsfml-dev libfreeimage-dev
```
For HIP acceleration (GPU cards):

```bash
# Follow the HIP SDK installation instructions for your distribution
# https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/install/install.html
```

### Compilation

CMAKE is used to build the project. list of variables that can be set: 
- `ENABLE_HIP`: Enable HIP GPU acceleration (default: OFF)
- `ENABLE_OPENMP`: Enable OpenMP parallel processing (default: OFF), **Not yet implemented.**
- `ENABLE_SEQUENTIAL`: Enable sequential processing (default: ON)
- `ROCM_PATH` to specify the location of a ROCm installation. (optional, *I guess*)

```bash
mkdir build_mandelbrot
cmake -S . -B build_mandelbrot -DENABLE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build_mandelbrot -j 4
```

### Controls

- **Navigation**: Use arrow keys to move around the fractal
- **Zoom**: Use `mousewheel` to zoom in and out
- **Iterations**: Use `a` to increase and `e` to decrease maximum iterations
- **Style**: Use `Tab` to switch between color schemes
- **Save**: Press `s` to save an image of the current view (not working !)

> **Note:** Window resizing doesn't work.

## Examples

Here are some examples of images generated by this project:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: nowrap; justify-content: space-between;">
   <div style="margin: auto;">
    <img src="img/mandelbrot_01.png" width="49%">
    <img src="img/mandelbrot_03.png" width="49%">
  </div>
</div>

## Future Development

1. **Getting rid of the SFML dependency**
2. More Zoom levels
4. **Support for other fractal types (Julia...)**
5. OpenMP use
3. More parameterization options for the fractal generation

## Technical Implementation

The project is structured into several components:

- **/core**: Global configuration and basic utilities
- **/fractal**: Implementation of calculation algorithms (sequential, OpenMP, HIP)
- **/sfml**: Management of graphical interface and events
- **/render**: Coloration and rendering of the fractal
